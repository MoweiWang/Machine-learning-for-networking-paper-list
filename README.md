Must-read papers on data-driven networking research that primarily apply machine learning techniques to the computer networking domain. The papers are mostly selected from major venues such as Sigcomm, NSDI, Mobicom, IMC, CoNEXT,INFOCOM, Hotnets, OSDI, SOSP, etc. Preprint papers with interesting topics or insights are also included here. Watch this repository for the latest updates!

## introduction

<!-- This is a paper list about data-driven networks. Different from traditional fine-tuning that uses an explicit classifier, prompt-based tuning directly uses the pre-trained models to conduct the pre-training tasks for classification or regression. -->

We use the following badges to highlight features of the paper.


![](https://img.shields.io/badge/pensieve-blue) The abbreviation of the work.

<!-- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Continous_Template-red) The key features in terms of prompt learning used in the work.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Generation-brown) The main explored task of the work.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Analysis-green) The main explored property of prompt learning methods in the work. -->
